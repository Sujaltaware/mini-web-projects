# 🎰 Lottery Game (React)

An interactive lottery-style number game built with **React**. Users click a button to generate **three random numbers** between 0–9, and if the **sum of those numbers equals 15**, the game shows a **winning pop-up message**.

This project demonstrates the use of **React hooks**, **random number logic**, **state management**, and **clean UI feedback** — wrapped in a fun and simple game.
